Tao.PostProcess does various post-processing on Tao Framework libraries.

This utility performs various hacks and changes to the Tao Framework
libraries.  For this to work you must supply the application the appropriate
input CIL file and an output filename:

    Tao.PostProcess.exe Tao.OpenGl.il1 Tao.OpenGl.il2

The following additional switches are also available:

    /D  - produces a debug build.  (not currently supported)
    /R  - produces a release build.  (default)
    /Y  - suppresses the overwrite file prompt.
