	- removed GlGenerator
	* src/Tao.OpenAl/AUTHORS
	- added Randy, Rob, Dave and myself

	* prj2make.sh
	- added this file.  This will be used by the build verification
	  tests (http://taobvt.colliertech.org) to verify the msvc build
	- note that the build currently fails.  This is better than the
	  "always fail" case that's currently happening, though.
	
2006-10-07  C.J. Adams-Collier  <cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* src/Tao.DevIl/prebuild.xml, src/Tao.Ode/prebuild.xml,
	  src/Tao.OpenGl/prebuild.xml, src/Tao.Lua/prebuild.xml -
	  commented <KeyFile> and <XmlDocFile> elements that were causing
	  nant build failure * build.sh - removed GlGenerator from the
	  list to build due to a "File Not Found" error - removed copy
	  commands for builds and docs that are broken
	
2006-10-05  C.J. Adams-Collier  <cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* clean.sh - created - supposedly reverses make.sh *
	CodingStandards - A place for proposed coding standards (patch
	formats, etc)

	* make.sh
	- cleared up directory changing stuff
	* src/Tao.OpenGl/prebuild.xml
	- commented out examples that don't build due to marshaling errors

        turned on exec bit for shell scripts, got rid of \r\n newlines


Tao.Ode 0.6.0.0 - July 25, 2006:
	Update to ODE 0.6 and conversion to .NET 2.0 essentially complete.
	The ODE 0.6 release consists of many bug fixes and
	improvements since the 0.5 release.
	There are also many documented and undocumented changes in the API.
	Notable changes: CCylinder renamed to Capsule
			 Support for geom offsets added
	This update also includes a patch from Markus Ewald to fix a bug in
	dGeomSetRotation and inspired related changes.  Thanks Markus.
