Todo:
+ Add the CLS compliant attribute to the Gl class.
+ Find the cause for the slow startup (probably the static constructor, but should investigate). Note that the equivalent opentk code does not suffer from this (why?)
+ See if anything can be done for the intellisense slowdown. Again, opentk does not suffer from this (or suffers to a lesser extent - probably the constants are killing it)
+ Find out why the shader compilation in the GLSL example seems to fail (although the cube renders correctly).
+ Clean up the code.
+ Add comments and documentation (faqs, pitfalls, best practices).
